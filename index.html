        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The stability of the planet could be enabled through the mobilization of education, and the diversity of knowledge, customs and culture.[4] Research suggests that embedding a deep attachment to landscapes and tangible heritage instils a sense of care for the world, that the study, preservation and appreciation of diverse languages, knowledge and customs enrich the collective consciousness through an understanding of the relations between past, present and future societies.Education plays a role to include sustainability studies as a means of driving planetary survival. Earth science and environment studies enable learners and communities to become more cognizant of the world they inhabit and leave behind.A ‘community of knowledge’ is one in which the responsibility of being a ‘knowledge keeper’ is returned to everyone.[8] This paradigm shifts the focus from the perspective of ‘stakeholder’ and changes the way of contributing to knowledge, aiming to achieve sustainable development. The future of education supports the cognitive practices of the groups and communities that recreate the values of their landscapes through the practices of cultural appreciation and symbolic recognition of places.[9]</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education for justice is the process of promoting a culture of lawfulness through educational activities at all levels. Education for justice aims at teaching the next generation about crime prevention, and to better understand and address problems that can undermine the rule of law.[1] It promotes peace and encourages students to actively engage in their communities and future professions.[2] Education for Justice is a basic legal knowledge, in which educational activities at all levels seek to promote understanding of crime prevention, peace, justice, human rights, and problems that can undermine the rule of law. Education reportedly plays a key role in transmitting and sustaining socio-cultural norms and ensuring their continued evolution.[3] As such, governments may seek to strengthen this promotion of a culture of lawfulness through education.</p>
